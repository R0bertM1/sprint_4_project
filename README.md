# sprint_4_project
This project is a web app that displays graphs made from a vehicle sales csv. The app contains check boxes that show or remove histagrams that show the distributions of the days listed based on the condition of the vehicle. There is also a scatterplot that plots the days listed by price. I used the pandas, streamlit, and plotly.express libraries to create this.

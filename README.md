# sprint_4_project
This project is a web app that displays graphs made from a vehicle sales csv. The app contains check boxes that show or remove histograms that show the distributions of the days listed based on the condition of the vehicle. There is also a scatterplot that plots the days listed by price. I used the pandas, streamlit and plotly.express libraries to create this.

This app can be accessed using this url: https://sprint-4-project-w6d6.onrender.com

Instructions for Launching the Project:

1. Install the required libraries by running: pip install streamlit numpy plotly
2. Save the provided Python script (`app.py`) to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal.
4. Navigate to the directory where you saved `app.py`.
5. Run the Streamlit app by executing the following command: streamlit run app.py
6. The app will open in your default web browser.
